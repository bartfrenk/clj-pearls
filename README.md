# Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design in Clojure

A clojure library containing algorithms from [Pearls of Functional Algorithm
Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521513383).

Currently implemented:
1. The smallest free number
2. A surpassing problem
3. Improving on saddleback search (except the fastest, binary search based solution)
